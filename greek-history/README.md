***Ancient Greece was a civilization belonging to a period of Greek history from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12thâ€“9th centuries BC to the end of antiquity (c. AD 600).***

Immediately following this period was the beginning of the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine era.

Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece, ***Greek urban poleis(city) began to form in the 8th century BC, ushering in the Archaic period and colonization of the Mediterranean Basin.***

This was followed by the period of ***Classical Greece, an era that began with the Greco-Persian Wars, lasting from the 5th to 4th centuries BC. 

***Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedon, Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea.*** 

The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire.
