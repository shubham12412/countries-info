https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe

Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. ***It is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, Asia to the east, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south***. It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia.


***The geographic border between Europe and Asia does not follow any state boundaries: Turkey, Russia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Kazakhstan are transcontinental countries.***


***Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which the Russian Federation is the largest and most populous.***


Europe, in particular ancient Greece and ancient Rome, was the birthplace of Western civilization.The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD and the subsequent Migration Period marked the end of ancient history and the beginning of the Middle Ages.

Since the Age of Discovery started by Portugal and Spain, Europe played a predominant role in global affairs. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European powers controlled at various times the Americas, almost all of Africa and Oceania and the majority of Asia.
