The Atlantic Ocean is the ***second largest of the world's oceans***. It covers approximately 20 percent of Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. ***It separates the "Old World" from the "New World".***


***The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between Europe and Africa to the east, and the Americas to the west.***

***As one component of the interconnected World Ocean, it is connected in the north to the Arctic Ocean, to the Pacific Ocean in the southwest, the Indian Ocean in the southeast, and the Southern Ocean in the south(other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to Antarctica).***
