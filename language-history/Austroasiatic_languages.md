https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austroasiatic_languages

***The Austroasiatic languages are a large language family of Mainland Southeast Asia, also scattered throughout parts of India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and southern China.*** 

There are around 117 million speakers of Austroasiatic languages.

***Of these languages, only Vietnamese, Khmer and Mon have a long-established recorded history and only Vietnamese and Khmer have official status as modern national languages (in Vietnam and Cambodia, respectively).*** 

In Myanmar, the Wa language is the de facto official language of Wa State. 

Santali is recognized as a regional language of India. 

The rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups and have no official status.


***Ethnologue identifies 168 Austroasiatic languages.***

Austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across Southeast Asia and parts of India, Bangladesh, Nepal and East Asia, separated by regions where other languages are spoken. 

***They appear to be the extant autochthonous languages of Southeast Asia (excluding the Andaman Islands), with the neighboring Indo-Aryan, Kraâ€“Dai, Hmong-Mien, Dravidian, Austronesian, and Sino-Tibetan languages being the result of later migrations.***


***The name Austroasiatic comes from a combination of the Latin words for "South" and "Asia", hence "South Asia".***
