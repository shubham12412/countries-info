https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravidian_languages

***The Dravidian languages are a language family spoken by more than 215 million people, mainly in Southern India and northern Sri Lanka, with pockets elsewhere in South Asia.***

Since the colonial era, there have been small but significant immigrant communities outside South Asia in countries such as Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Mauritius and the Philippines.

***Epigraphically the Dravidian languages are first attested in the 2nd century BCE as Tamil-Brahmi script on the cave walls discovered in the Madurai and Tirunelveli districts of Tamil Nadu.***

***The Dravidian languages with the most speakers are (in descending order of number of speakers) Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam, all of which have long literary traditions***. 

Smaller literary languages are Tulu and Kodava. 

There are also small groups of Dravidian-speaking scheduled tribes, who live outside Dravidian-speaking areas, such as the Kurukh in Eastern India and Gondi in Central India.


Only two Dravidian languages are spoken exclusively outside the post-1947 state of India: Brahui in the Balochistan region of Pakistan and Afghanistan; and Dhangar, a dialect of Kurukh, in parts of Nepal and Bhutan.
