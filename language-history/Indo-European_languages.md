The Indo-European languages are a language family of several hundred related languages and dialects.

1) ***There are about 445 living Indo-European languages, according to the estimate by Ethnologue, with over two thirds (313) of them belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch.*** 

2) ***The Indo-European languages with the greatest numbers of native speakers are Spanish, English, Hindustani (Hindi/Urdu), Portuguese, Bengali, Punjabi, and Russian, each with over 100 million speakers, with German, French, Marathi, Italian, and Persian also having more than 50 million.*** 

3) ***Today, 46% of the world's population (3.2 billion) speaks an Indo-European language as a first language, by far the highest of any language family.***

The Indo-European family includes most of the modern languages of Europe. 

The language family is also represented in Asia with the exception of East and Southeast Asia. 

It was prominent (alongside non- Indo-European languages) in ancient Anatolia (present-day Turkey), the ancient Tarim Basin (present-day Northwest China) and most of Central Asia until the medieval Turkic and Mongol invasions.

Outside Eurasia, Indo-European languages are dominant in the Americas and much of Oceania and Africa, having reached there through colonialism during the Age of Discovery and later periods. 

Indo-European languages are also most commonly present as minority languages or second languages in countries where other families are dominant.
