***The Kra–Dai languages (also known as Tai–Kadai, Daic and Kadai) are a language family of tonal languages found in southern China, Northeast India and Southeast Asia.***

***They include Thai and Lao, the national languages of Thailand and Laos respectively.***

***Around 93 million people speak Kra–Dai languages, 60% of whom speak Thai***.Ethnologue lists 95 languages in the family, with 62 of these being in the Tai branch.

The high diversity of Kra–Dai languages in southern China points to the origin of the Kra–Dai language family in southern China. The Tai branch moved south into Southeast Asia only around 1000 AD.

Genetic and linguistic analysis show great homogeneity between Kra-Dai speaking people in Thailand.
