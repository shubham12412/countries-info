***achaemenid Empire***

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire

***The Achaemenid Empire (550â€“330 BC), also called the First Persian Empire,was an ancient Iranian empire based in Western Asia founded by Cyrus the Great. Ranging at its greatest extent from the Balkans and Eastern Europe proper in the west to the Indus Valley in the east, it was larger than any previous empire in history.***


Alexander the Great, an avid admirer of Cyrus the Great,conquered most of the empire by 330 BC.Upon Alexander's death, most of the empire's former territory fell under the rule of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Seleucid Empire, in addition to other minor territories which gained independence at that time. The Iranian elites of the central plateau reclaimed power by the second century BC under the Parthian Empire.
