The Mediterranean Sea is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and ***almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia(Asian Turkey), on the south by North Africa and on the east by the Levant(historical region of syria)***. Although the sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, it is usually referred to as a separate body of water.
