Russia or the Russian Federation is a transcontinental country in Eastern Europe and North Asia.


***Russia is, by a considerable margin, the largest country in the world by area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area*** and the ninth most populous. ***About 77% of the population live in the western, European part of the country***. Russia's capital, Moscow, is one of the largest cities in the world and the second largest city in Europe.


Extending across the entirety of Northern Asia and much of Eastern Europe, ***Russia spans eleven time zones*** and incorporates a wide range of environments and landforms.


***Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, twelve independent republics emerged from the USSR: 
Russia, \
Ukraine, \
Belarus, \
Kazakhstan, \
Uzbekistan, \
Armenia, \
Azerbaijan, \
Georgia, \
Kyrgyzstan, \
Moldova, \
Tajikistan, \
Turkmenistan \
and the Baltic states regained independence: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania***;  \
the Russian SFSR reconstituted itself as the Russian Federation and is recognized as the continuing legal personality and a successor of the Soviet Union.
